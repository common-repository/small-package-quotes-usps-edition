= How do I get a API key for my plugin? =

You must register your installation of the plugin, regardless of whether you are taking advantage of the trial period or
purchased an API key outright. At the conclusion of the registration process an email will be sent to you that will include
the API key key. You can also login to eniture.com using the username and password you created during the registration process
and retrieve the API key key from the My API keys tab.

= How do I change my plugin API key from the trail version to one of the paid subscriptions? =

Login to eniture.com and navigate to the My API keys tab. There you will be able to manage the licensing of all of your Eniture Technology plugins.

= How do I install the plugin on another website? =

The plugin has a single site API key. To use it on another website you will need to purchase an additional API key. If you want
to change the website with which the plugin is registered, login to eniture.com and navigate to the My API keys tab. There you will
be able to change the domain name that is associated with the API key.

= Do I have to purchase a second API key for my staging or development site? =

No. Each API key allows you to identify one domain for your production environment and one domain for your staging or
development environment. The rate estimates returned in the staging environment will have the word ‚ÄúSandbox‚Ä? appended to them.

= Why isn‚Äôt the plugin working on my other website? =

If you can successfully test your credentials from the Connection page (WooCommerce > Settings > Usps > Connections)
then you have one or more of the following licensing issue(s): 1) You are using the API key on more than one domain.
The API keys are for single sites. You will need to purchase an additional API key. 2) Your trial period has expired.
3) Your current API key has expired and we have been unable to process your form of payment to renew it. Login to eniture.com and
go to the My API keys tab to resolve any of these issues.

= Why were the shipment charges I received on the invoice from Usps different than what was quoted by the plugin? =

Common reasons include one of the shipment parameters (weight, dimensions) is different, or additional services (such as residential
delivery) were required. Compare the details of the invoice to the shipping settings on the products included in the shipment.
Consider making changes as needed. Remember that the weight of the packing materials is included in the billable weight for the shipment.
If you are unable to reconcile the differences call your local Worldwide Express office for assistance.

= Why do I sometimes get a message that a shipping rate estimate couldn‚Äôt be provided? =

There are several possibilities:

* Usps has restrictions on a shipment‚Äôs maximum weight, length and girth which your shipment may have exceeded.
* There wasn‚Äôt enough information about the weight or dimensions for the products in the shopping cart to retrieve a shipping rate estimate.
* The usps.com isn‚Äôt operational.
* Your Usps account has been suspended or cancelled.
* Your Eniture Technology API key for this plugin has expired.
